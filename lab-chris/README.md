## Description
401 JS -- lab 26

Started with copying Duncan's code while in class. Took me a while to figure out how to integrate the cowsay stuff but after that it was pretty much done. Added some of the Sass stuff. I found that if I took a reset we had created earlier in class and basically copied it in that it made my cow disappear. I went with basically what Duncan did in class after that.
